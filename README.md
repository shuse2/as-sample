## hello

### Consideration
- Unit of wasm compilation
    - Unit of update of the logic? (per module/command vs whole state machine)
    - To enable further protocol, what is necesssary?

- Size of the built binary
- How to communicate which env can be meaningfully used in which hooks/methods/endpoint
- How to strucure plugin, and how to distinguish plugin env
